# Frontend Documentation for Youtube Summarizer

## Overview
The Youtube Summarizer is a web application that allows users to summarize YouTube videos by extracting their transcripts and generating concise summaries. This project consists of a backend built with Flask and a frontend developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Frontend Structure
The frontend of the application is located in the `frontend` directory and includes the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the web application.
- **app.js**: The JavaScript file that handles user interactions, makes API calls to the backend, and updates the UI based on responses.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file that defines the visual appearance of the web pages.
